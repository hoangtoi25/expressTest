### Details
Your task is to calculate the total price for all the phone calls. The data is in the folder `data/callLog.json`

When we go to `/`, respond the answer in `json` format with the total number calls along with total price. You can calculate the price by following these rules:

> A **toll-free number** is a number that has prefix 800, 833, 866, or 888 after the country code. Otherwise, it's a local number.
> 
> The default country code for any phone number in the data file is `+1` (USA or Canada) if it's missing.
> 
> Note that the phone numbers in the log may have be in different format, with or without the country code.

* For **inbound** or **outbound** call to a local phone number, the cost is `1 cent` for each second.
* For inbound call to a toll-free number, the cost is `3 cents` for each second.
* For outbound call to a toll-free number, the cost is `2 cents` for each second.

Example data returned

```javascript
GET /
{
    totalCalls: 87,
    totalCost: 187273
}
```

Thank you and good luck! üôè
